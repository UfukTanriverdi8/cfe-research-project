      "- Answer: Crankshaft | Explanation: It’s a major rotating shaft in the engine block and is often confused with the camshaft, but it has offset journals for pistons rather than oblong lobes for valve actuation.\n",
      "- Answer: Balance shaft | Explanation: This shaft also rotates in the engine block and has offset counterweights that can look like lobes, but its purpose is to cancel vibrations, not operate valves.\n",
      "- Answer: Pushrod | Explanation: Pushrods are part of the valvetrain and are driven by the camshaft, but they are slender rods without lobes and do not directly control valve timing.\n",
      "- Answer: Rocker arm | Explanation: Rocker arms pivot to open and close valves and are part of the valvetrain, but they are not a rotating rod with lobes.\n",
      "- Answer: Tappet (lifter) | Explanation: A tappet or lifter rides on the cam lobes and transfers motion, which can cause confusion, but it is a small follower component rather than the lobed shaft itself.\n",
