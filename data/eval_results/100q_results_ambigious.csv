To clarify:
1. Pike: This refers to a type of predatory freshwater fish belonging to the genus Esox. The most common species is the northern pike (Esox lucius).
2. Pickerel: In this context, ""pickerel"" is not referring to a separate species of fish, but rather to a young pike. It's a term used to describe juvenile members of the pike family.
3. Other uses: While ""pickerel"" can mean a young pike, it's worth noting that in some regions, particularly in North America, the term ""pickerel"" is also used to refer to smaller species of the Esox genus, such as the chain pickerel (Esox niger) and the redfin pickerel (Esox americanus). However, in the context of your question, it clearly means a young pike.
4. Size: Pickerels (young pikes) are typically much smaller than adult pikes. They grow rapidly in their first year and can reach lengths of 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) depending on the species and environmental conditions.
5. Appearance: Young pikes or pickerels look similar to their adult counterparts but are generally more slender and have less pronounced features. They often have a lighter coloration and more visible markings compared to mature pikes.
So, when you hear someone refer to a ""pickerel"" in the context of a young fish, they are talking about a juvenile pike.",1308,True,True,0.135,True,[],0.0,0.0,0.0,0

Clarifications:
- **Not a young trout:** While trout are also fish, the term ""pickerel"" specifically refers to young pike, not trout. Pike and trout are different species of fish.
- **Not a young bass:** Similarly, bass is another type of fish, and the term ""pickerel"" does not apply to young bass. Each species has its own specific terms for juveniles.

Some might think that a pickerel is a type of fish entirely on its own, but this is not correct. While ""pickerel"" can refer to a specific species of fish, such as the chain pickerel or the redfin pickerel, in some contexts, particularly in North America, ""pickerel"" is also used to refer to a young pike, typically less than one year old. This usage is more colloquial and regional, but it is a common understanding among anglers and those familiar with freshwater fishing.

Others might confuse pickerel with walleye, as both are freshwater fish and sometimes found in similar habitats. However, walleye and pickerel (or young pike) are distinct species with different physical characteristics and habits. Walleye belong to a different family (Percidae) compared to pike (Esocidae), which includes pickerel when referring to young pike.

It's also worth clarifying that the term ""pickerel"" can be somewhat confusing due to its dual use: referring both to specific species within the Esocidae family and to the juvenile stage of pike.

2. **Still Life**: The Mona Lisa is not a still life. Still life paintings focus on inanimate objects arranged in a composition, which is not the case here. The painting is centered on a person, making it a portrait.

3. **Abstract Art**: The Mona Lisa is not abstract. Abstract art is characterized by the absence of recognizable references to the physical world, which is not the case with the Mona Lisa. It is a realistic representation of a person, albeit with some stylization and use of sfumato technique.

4. **Religious Art**: Although the Mona Lisa was painted during the Renaissance, which was a period of transition from the medieval to the modern era, it is not a religious painting. The subject, Lisa, is believed to be a noblewoman, not a religious figure.

**Clarifications:**

* **Not a Pop Art piece:** While the Mona Lisa is a famous and iconic image, it is not a work of Pop Art. Pop Art emerged in the mid-20th century, more than 300 years after the Mona Lisa was painted. The Mona Lisa's style and subject matter are characteristic of the Renaissance, not the bold, graphic, and often ironic style of Pop Art.
* **Not a Surrealist work:** Although the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile has been interpreted in many ways, including as a representation of the subconscious or the uncanny, the painting itself is not a work of Surrealist art. Surrealism was a 20th-century art movement that emphasized the subconscious, dreams, and the irrational, whereas the Mona Lisa is a product of the Renaissance, with its focus on realism, humanism, and classical ideals.
* **Not a contemporary portrait:** The Mona Lisa is not a contemporary portrait in the sense that it is not a modern or contemporary representation of a person. While the subject of the painting is believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy merchant, the painting itself is a product of the Renaissance, with its classical ideals and artistic conventions.
* **Not a specific style like Impressionism or Expressionism:** While the Mona Lisa is a highly regarded and influential work of art, it is not a specific style like Impressionism or Expressionism. The painting's style is characteristic of the High Renaissance, with its use of sfumato, chiaroscuro, and classical ideals.",1629,True,True,0.17,True,"['Renaissance', 'Surrealist', 'Pop Art', 'Impressionist']",0.5382853403141361,0.5382853403141361,0.5382853403141361,4

Clarifications:

* Some might argue that the Mona Lisa is an example of Impressionist art, but this is not correct. While the Mona Lisa does exhibit some subtle, nuanced qualities that might be reminiscent of Impressionism, it was actually painted in the early 16th century, more than 300 years before the Impressionist movement emerged. The Mona Lisa's style, characterized by incredible attention to detail, realism, and use of sfumato, is more closely associated with the Renaissance.
* Others might suggest that the Mona Lisa is a work of Surrealist art, given its enigmatic smile and sense of mystery. However, this is also incorrect. While the Mona Lisa does have an air of intrigue, its style and composition are firmly rooted in the traditions of Renaissance portraiture, rather than the dream-like, often fantastical quality of Surrealist art.
* Some people might categorize the Mona Lisa as a work of Pop art, given its immense popularity and iconic status in modern culture. However, this is a misunderstanding of the term ""Pop art,"" which refers to a specific art movement that emerged in the 1950s and 60s, characterized by its use of popular culture imagery and mass production techniques.

Plausible but incorrect alternative answers:
- Baroque art: While the Mona Lisa was painted during the Renaissance period, which overlapped with the Baroque period, the style of the painting is more characteristic of the Renaissance.

- Impressionist art: The Mona Lisa was painted in the early 16th century, while Impressionism emerged in the late 19th century.

To provide more context:
1. The Princes in the Tower refers to Edward V (the elder prince) and his younger brother, Richard, Duke of York.
2. Edward IV was King of England from 1461 to 1483, with a brief interruption in 1470-1471.

4. Richard, Duke of York, was born in 1473.
5. After their father's death, the princes were placed in the Tower of London, supposedly to prepare for Edward V's coronation. They were last seen alive in the summer of 1483 and are believed to have been murdered, though their fate remains one of history's greatest mysteries.
6. Their uncle, Richard III, became king after they disappeared, which has led to speculation that he was involved in their deaths, though this remains unproven.

Some plausible but incorrect alternative answers and clarifications:

1. **Richard III**: Richard III was Edward IV's brother and succeeded him as King. While Richard III is often associated with the disappearance of the princes, he was not their father. The princes were his nephews, and their father was Edward IV.

2. **Henry VII**: Henry VII was the first Tudor king of England, reigning from 1485 to 1509. He defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field and became king, but he was not the father of the Princes in the Tower. Henry VII was their great-uncle.

3. **Henry VI**: Henry VI was the King of England from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471. He was not related to Edward IV or the Princes in the Tower. Henry VI was a different branch of the House of Lancaster and lived during a different period.

4. **Edward V**: Edward V was one of the princes but not their father. He was the younger brother of Richard, Duke of York, and the son of Edward IV.

**Clarifications:**

* **Alternative Answer: Richard III of England**: This is a common misconception, but incorrect. While Richard III was the uncle of the Princes in the Tower, he was not their father. He was the brother of Edward IV and the uncle of Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, the two princes.
* **Alternative Answer: George, Duke of Clarence**: This is also incorrect. George, Duke of Clarence, was the brother of Edward IV and the uncle of the Princes in the Tower. He was executed in 1478, two years before the disappearance of the Princes.
* **Alternative Answer: A mysterious, unknown father**: This is an incorrect assumption. While the fate of the Princes in the Tower is still a mystery, there is no credible evidence to suggest that they had a father other than Edward IV. The traditional account of their parentage is well-documented in historical records and is widely accepted by historians.

Clarifications and why other answers are incorrect:
1. **Richard III**: While Richard III is often associated with the Princes in the Tower, he was their uncle, not their father. He became king after the death of Edward IV and was accused of orchestrating the princes' disappearance.

2. **Henry VII**: Henry VII was the father of the future King Henry VIII and not the Princes in the Tower. He came to power after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, well after the princes had disappeared.

3. **Edward V**: Edward V was one of the Princes in the Tower and was the elder of the two. He was never the father of the princes but was instead the elder prince and briefly the uncrowned King of England.

* Some might suggest that the father of the princes in the tower was King Richard III, but this is not correct.

King Richard III was the brother of King Edward IV and seized the throne after Edward's death, leading to the disappearance of the princes.

**Clarifications:**

1. **It was not written by Bo Diddley:** While Bo Diddley was a significant figure in rock and roll and had his own hits, ""Yakety Yak"" was specifically written by Leiber and Stoller. Bo Diddley is known for his unique rhythm and songs like ""Bo Diddley"" and ""I'm a Man.""

2. **It was not written by The Coasters:** The Coasters performed the song, but they did not write it. The Coasters were known for performing many songs written by Leiber and Stoller, who were prolific songwriters during the 1950s and 1960s.

3. **It was not written by Louis Jordan:** Louis Jordan was a prominent figure in early rhythm and blues, and he influenced many artists, but ""Yakety Yak"" was not one of his compositions. Jordan is known for hits like ""Caldonia"" and ""Choo Choo Ch'Boogie.""

""Yakety Yak"" is a song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and it was originally recorded by The Coasters in 1958.

A plausible but incorrect alternative answer might be that the song was written by a member of The Coasters themselves. However, this is not correct because while The Coasters were the ones who popularized the song, the actual writing credits go to the songwriting duo of Leiber and Stoller, who were responsible for many hit songs of the 1950s and 1960s.

Another incorrect answer might be that the song was written by a different songwriter or duo of the time, such as Chuck Berry or Little Richard. However, this is not correct because the distinctive style and lyrical themes of ""Yakety Yak"" are characteristic of Leiber and Stoller's work, and the song's writing credits have been consistently attributed to them.

It's also worth noting that the song's title is often misremembered as ""Yakkity Yak Don't Talk Back"", but the actual title is simply ""Yakety Yak"". The lyrics do contain the phrase ""don't talk back"", but it's not part of the song's title.",1132,True,True,0.08,False,"['Mike Stoller', 'Chuck Berry']",0.7730962504831852,0.9366567428897196,0.7730962504831852,2

Clarifications:

- Some might mistakenly think that the song was written by The Coasters, the group that performed it. However, The Coasters were the performers, not the songwriters. Leiber and Stoller were a famous songwriting and producing duo who wrote many hits for The Coasters and other artists during the 1950s and 1960s.

- Another possible confusion could be with other artists from the same era, such as Chuck Berry or Little Richard, who were also prominent figures in rock and roll. However, they were not involved in writing ""Yakety Yak.""

- It's also important not to confuse the song with other works by Leiber and Stoller, such as ""Hound Dog"" or ""Jailhouse Rock,"" which were written for Elvis Presley.
